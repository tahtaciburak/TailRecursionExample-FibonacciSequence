# Tail Recursion Example - Fibonacci Sequence
A funtion call uses stack for return to same point. In some cases recursion will be a blame for programmers. Becasue limited resources can not response all of requests. Such as complex nested recursions.And you may face with <b>StackOverflow<b/>According to general approach, recursive functions starts to calculate at first point but tail recursion starts from back.And reduces your stack usage.At this example I write a function called <code>unsigned long int fibTail(int,unsigned long int,unsigned long int)</code>. As a critical point, I pass 2 more parameter of this function. The first one is <code>current_value</code> and second is <code>last_value</code>
